Clippy
======

📎+🕶️ = They live!

Homage to the O.G. digital assistant nobody wanted, but everybody got anyway.

Should work on firefox [add-on link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/artificial-clippy/), chrome, safari, ie, opera.

Usage
-----

Install the extension. If you open a page that tries to sell you AI or
kleptocurrency terms, the paperclip icon will show on the bottom right corner
to signal you've been saved and the marketing speak was replaced by plain
english.

This will save you from FOMO and preserve your mental health.

If you want to see the real content, just disable the extension. When enabled,
the extension will NEVER change content without showing the paperclip on the
corner.
